so right now...
I'm planning to make this thing usable by other people. And with the least effort possible in setting up.
What I'm planning to do is
First, I'll try to get the files the normal way, then add an except block in the get_files function.
If that exception, then the user is redirected to a place where they can set up the folder names. 

So I should make sure that the user gets to do this only once. (ease). Unless of course they're trying to 
pull my strings. But that's OK.
There are 2 ways of checking if they haven't set up; try-and-except, and checking the database. I'll use 
the former for now. So next...
I'll lead them to create their categories. So the CATEGORIES variable will now be something like:
 = [fc.name for fc in FileCategory.objects.all()]. 
So after they have set up, I'll create the folders for them.
I'll clear all folders(not files) in that dir if any, before doing so, so WARN THEM.
Next up...
The template. I'll dynamize the template from here using the FileCategories the user will create.
what's left?...

so let me test...
This guy goes, and reads the manual(what's in the manual?), and then pulls
Then he goes to port 8000 or whatever. (Another thing, I'll try to see if I can make it automatically run like in I did in Ubuntu)
Then he obviously hasn't set up so he's directed to create_categories.html
By the way, I'm going to clear the database everytime you go there to start afresh. (I'll see if I can make them editable)
He types stuff, and folders are created, after he's been warned. 
Then he literally should be good to go from here.
